# LeetCode

In this repo, I add my attempts and notes while solving Leet Code problems.

## Basics

The following tables contain the basics that should be well studied:

### Data Structures

| Data Structure | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| Linked Lists   | [x]    |
| Trees          | [ ]    |
| Tries          | [ ]    |
| Graphs         | [ ]    |
| Stacks         | [x]    |
| Queues         | [x]    |
| Heaps          | [ ]    |
| Vectors        | [x]    |
| ArrayLists     | [x]    |
| Hash Tables    | [x]    |

### Algorithms

| Algorithm            | Status |
|----------------------|--------|
| Breadth-First Search | [ ]    |
| Depth-First Search   | [ ]    |
| Binary Search        | [x]    |
| Merge Sort           | [x]    |
| Quick Sort           | [x]    |

### Concepts

| Concepts                | Status |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Bit Manipulation        | [x]    |
| Memory (Stack vs. heap) | [ ]    |
| Recursion               | [x]    |
| Dynamic Programming     | [ ]    |
| Big O Time & Space      | [x]    |
