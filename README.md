In this repo, I add my attempts and notes while solving Leet Code problems.

## Bitwise Operators

The following 6 operators are bitwise operators:

### The **Bitwise AND** `&`

It takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of the two numbers. The result of AND is `1` only if the two
operands are `1.

| A   | B   | AND |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

- The **Bitwise OR** `|`
- The **Bitwise XOR** `^`
- Left shift `<<`
- Right shift `>>`
- The **Bitwise NOT** `~`
