# Bitwise Operators

The following 6 operators are bitwise operators:

## The **Bitwise AND** `&`

It takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of the two numbers. The result of AND is `1` only if the two
operands are `1.

| A   | B   | AND |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

## The **Bitwise OR** `|`

It takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of the two numbers. The result of OR is `1` if any of the two
bits is `1`.

| A   | B   | OR   |
|-----|-----|------|
| 0   | 0   | 0    |
| 0   | 1   | 1    |
| 1   | 0   | 1    |
| 1   | 1   | 1    |

## The **Bitwise NOT** `~`

It takes one number and inverts all bit of it.

| A   | NOT |
|-----|-----|
| 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   |

## The **Bitwise XOR** `^`

It takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit. The result of XOR os `1` if the two bits are different.

| A   | B   | XOR |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

- Left shift `<<`
- Right shift `>>`
