# Sequences

Sequences are ordered lists of numbers that are called "terms". Some sequences follow a specific pattern that can be
used to extend them indefinitely. For example 2,5,8 follows the pattern "add 3" and we can continue the sequence.

## Arithmetic sequences

In an arithmetic sequence the difference between one term and the next is a constant. In other words we just add the
same value each time.

Example:

**{1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, ...}**

This pattern is continued by adding 3 the last number each time.

In general, we could write an arithmetic sequence like this:

**{a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ...}**

- `a` is the first term.
- `d` is the difference between terms. "Common Difference"

We can write the arithmetic sequence as a rule:
